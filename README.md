# Hold my beer...
That's what mostly I say when I face a challenge I, probably, can't go through. Yet I'll finish it :)

## My name is... Sam :cat: :fox_face:
Mostly represented by a cat but feeling like a fox, if you get me. I'll demonstrate that foxes are like cats, but with dog hardware and kitten software- mischievous little things.

I code for fun, and I try to have one or two projects and maybe in the future, more. Currently working on small simple stuff that can make a few hobbyist roleplaying people feel happy, and angry at the fact Twitter (mill you, buddy) will probably have its API free again- I break the concept anyway and try to make my application through it. Hardcoding isn't good, but seriously being a small developer in a group of one with a small amount of benefits to pay my cat's food? Well, better do it and update it from time to time than paying something I can't afford.

Coding should be free, anyways. I get it. Profits. But well, damn you, Melon.

### Why are you still here?

I code, or I try to. Unfortunately I don't work in the area I like and probably love because hell I like aesthetics and web page front building tecnologies (aight, it doesn't have to be WEBPAGE, but we get the deal).

English is not my first language, and I kind of have a weird sense of humour, sarcasm and predisposal weird love for cats, sharks and foxes. Might change my name to Azeri, sounds like Azure, but means fox in basque which makes it waaaaaay long better.

I also like silly short stupid humour, like those jokes you tell but nobody would laugh and the room would end up feeling awkward? Got you, I'd crack.
